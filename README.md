# Javascript-pet-game

Once a mentor of mine said the best way to learn coding is to dig deeper into game development. Here I am trying to create a simple gaming application to dig deeper into Javascript. So whats this ? its a pet game with JS, to learn more about application state management using state machines, and using tools like ESLint, Parcel, and Prettier.
